      You can buy vanilla ice cream at any grocery store, but it’ll never taste
      as good as the stuff you make yourself. This homemade ice cream is rich
      and creamy, with an indulgent vanilla flavor that even chocolate
      aficionados will love. And the best part? This homemade ice cream recipe
      is so easy to make. We’re talking 5 ingredients and 15-ish minutes of
      hands-on prep. Full disclosure, there are a few hands-off parts of this
      recipe that require some patience, but once you taste this homemade ice
      cream, I think you’ll agree that every second of waiting was worth it. It
      really is the best summer treat.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1½ cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1½ cups whole milk</li>
      <li>⅔ cup cane sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt.
        Warm over medium-low heat, whisking often, for 5 minutes, or until the
        sugar dissolves and the mixture is warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour into a heatproof bowl, cover, and chill for 2 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the chilled ice cream base from the fridge and whisk well. Churn
        in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
        typically 20 to 30 minutes. The ice cream will be soft after churning.
        For firmer ice cream, transfer to an airtight container and freeze for 2
        to 4 hours before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to a month. If the
        ice cream is too firm to scoop straight from the freezer, let sit at
        room temperature for a few minutes to soften.
      </li>
    </ol>
